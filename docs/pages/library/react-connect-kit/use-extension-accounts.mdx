# useExtensionAccounts

A hook that fetches and subscribes to extension accounts.

[source](https://github.com/w3ux/w3ux-library/tree/main/library/react-connect-kit/src/Extensions/Accounts/index.tsx)

## Usage

`useExtensionAccounts` provides a simple means of fetching and subscribing to web3 extensions accounts in any component wrapped with `ExtensionsProvider`:

It also automatically re-connects to extensions on subsequent visits by referring to saved local
storage data.

<Callout type="note">
  This provider prevents the multiple pop-up issue (all available extensions popping up when connecting to extensions) by design. Such behaviour should be treated as an anti-pattern and be avoided.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  When React.StrictMode is used inside the Application, it should be placed after the ExtensionsProvider and `ExtensionAccountsProvider`, or the providers will not work;
</Callout>

### Connecting Extensions

With the providers in place, you can call `connectExtension` to connect to an extension. The following example attempts to find and connect to Subwallet JS upon a button click.

```tsx
import {
    useExtensionAccounts,
  } from '@w3ux/react-connect-kit';

const ConnectAccounts = () => {
  const { connectExtension } = useExtensionAccounts();

  return (
    <>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => {
          if (extension) connectExtension('subwallet-js');
        }}
      >
        Connect to Subwallet JS
      </button>
      <App />
    </>
  );
);
```

## Interface

#### extensionsInitialised
`string[]`

A record of the extensions that have been initialised along with their status.


#### connectExtension

Call this function to connect to the provided extension id and subscribe to its accounts.

#### getExtensionAccounts
`(ss58: number) => ImportedAccount[]`

Geta a list of available extension accounts, formatted by the provided ss58 prefix.

#### extensionsSynced
`'unsynced' | 'syncing' | 'synced'`

Signals whether extensions are still being synced upon being initialised.
