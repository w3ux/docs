# useExtensions

A hook that interacts with extensions and exposes their status.

[source](https://github.com/w3ux/w3ux-library/tree/main/library/react-connect-kit/src/Extensions/Connect.tsx)

## Usage

Extensions data can be accessed with the `useExtensions` hook in any component wrapped with `ExtensionsProvider`:

```tsx
import { useExtensions } from '@w3ux/react-connect-kit';

const extensions = useExtensions();
```

## Syncing Extensions

Web3 extensions are injected into the `window.injectedWeb3` object, which is an asynchronous process that happens when the window loads. For this reason, `ExtensionsProvider` also provides a `gettingExtensions` boolean value, that signals whether the initial check for injectedWeb3 is underway.

`gettingExtensions` will initially be true, and updated to false once `window.injectedWeb3` is present, or if injectedWeb3 is not found after a 5 second timeout.

## Interface

#### gettingExtensions
`boolean`

Returns a boolean reflecting whether `window.injectedWeb3` is being checked.

#### extensionsStatus
``Record<string, Extens`ionStatus>``

A key value record of each extension and their status. Empty object by default until `setExtensionStatus` is called.

#### setExtensionStatus
`(id: string, status: ExtensionStatus): void`

A function that takes an extension id and status, and updates the extensionsStatus record. Accepts values of `installed`, `not_authenticated` and `connected`.

#### removeExtensionStatus
`(id: string): void`

Removes an extension from the `extensionsStatus` record. This should be called when the extension is not found / not installed.

#### extensionInstalled
`(id: string): boolean`

A function that takes an extension id checks whether the extension is installed.

#### extensionCanConnect
`(id: string): boolean`

Checks if the provided extension id can be connected to. Returns false if the extension is not installed or is not connected.
